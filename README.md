# RoleRegister

RoleRegister is a **self-contained, local-first job application assistant**.  
It helps you track job postings, highlight key requirements, monitor application status, and measure progress in your job hunt — all without phoning home or depending on any central server.

## Features

- **Job Posting Records**  
  Add job postings directly into the app (paste, upload, or import). Each posting is stored locally on your machine.

- **Call-Out Highlights**  
  Extract and mark important pieces of a job description (e.g., *“3 years of Java”*) as call-outs for later review.

- **Status Tracking**  
  Track each posting’s lifecycle: *applied*, *interviewing*, *offer*, *rejected*, or custom statuses defined by you.

- **Metrics Dashboard**  
  See statistics about your job hunt:  
  - Number of postings saved  
  - Application outcomes  
  - Interview ratios  
  - Average turnaround times  

- **Local-First, Private by Design**  
  All data is stored locally. The app does **not** transmit your information to any central service.  
  - No remote accounts.  
  - No transmission of analytics.  
  - Optional: automatic update checks (can be disabled).
